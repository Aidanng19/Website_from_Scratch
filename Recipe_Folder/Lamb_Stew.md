## Ingredients
1 qt Lamb Chunks\
4 Carrots\
2 Potatoes\
1 Onion\
Celery

# Dry Seasonings
Salt\
Black Pepper\
Bay Leaves\
Italian Seasoning\
Ginger\
Garlic

# Wet Seasonings
Worcestershire Sauce\
Shaoxing Wine\
Olive Oil

## Instructions
1. Oil the bottom of the instant pot with olive oil. Put the ingredients in and saute on high with dry seasonings to force the flavor into the ingredients.
2. Pour in the wet seasonings and water until it almost covers the ingredients. You want some of it uncovered because the vegetables will release water contents as it cooks.
3. Pressure cook for 30 minutes and naturally release. This take roughly 2 hours total. 

## Notes
11/22/2025: I increased the cooking time to 30 minutes because I could see gelatin when I cooked for 15 minutes last time. I didn't add broth because I wanted to see how tasteful my broth would be without help. I could see scum at the top of the soup, so try soaking or pre-boiling the meat beforehand. My lamb wasn't dry and fell off the bone, so I like this cooking time more. The soup tasted pretty good, not too sour, so I won't be adding broth in the future.
