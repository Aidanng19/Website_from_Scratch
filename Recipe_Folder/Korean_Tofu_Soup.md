## Instructions
1. Heat chili oil in the pot.
2. Crack the egg on top of the chili oil. We crack this now so that the egg is fried and not boiled. 
3. Add diced spam, green onions, and minced garlic and saute. We do this to sear the ingredients before adding the water.
4. Add chili powder, beef dashida, sugar, and fish sauce. Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients and bring to a boil.
5. Add soft tofu, noodles, bok choy, and any other seafood you want. Then cook for 5 more minutes until it's cooked.
