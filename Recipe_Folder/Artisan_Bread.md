# Notes
11/24/2025: I added sugar to my bread and it definitely added a little extra flavor that I thought my last batch was missing. I didn't like the sugar aftertaste, but I think that might just be me because my coworkers liked it. I like the current recipe and I'll add chocolate next time and see how that ends up.
