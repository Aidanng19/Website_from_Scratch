## Notes
11/19/2025 First attempt: I crammed my pan so the liquid didn't cover the potatoes, therefore undercooking half of my potatoes. Also I added too much milk so there was too much liquid and it didn't boil down properly. I didn't mix the sauce properly beforehand, so the milk and cheese weren't evenly mixed. I should've mixed everything at once, using the milk as a base, to form a roux.
