## Ingredients
1 tbsp miso:1 cup water\
1 piece Kombu (Dried kelp)\
1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)\
Silken Tofu\
Dried wakame seaweed\
Green Onion/Scallion

## Instructions
1. Soak the kombu in water from 1 hour to 12 hours to extract the umami from the kombu. 
2. Slowly bring the water to a boil over roughly 10 minutes and remove the kombu before reaching a full boil. The water should be a little green/slimy at this point?
3. Add miso to the water and stir it to prevent the miso from clumping up.
4. Add the tofu, katsuobushi, and seaweed as the soup is simmering.
5. Reduce the heat before the miso reaches a full boil and let it sit for >5 minutes.
6. If the miso needs to be reheated, reheat it slowly without boiling it or it'll lose its flavor.
