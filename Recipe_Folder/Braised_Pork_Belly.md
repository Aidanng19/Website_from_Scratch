## Ingredients
Pork Belly\
Potatoes\
Carrots

# Dry Seasonings
Salt\
Star Anise\
Bay Leaves\
Ginger\
Rock sugar\
Scallions

# Wet Seasonings
Light soy sauce\
Dark soy sauce\
Shaoxing wine\
Water

## Instructions
1. Cut the pork belly into medium sized pieces.
2. Parboil the pork belly to draw out impurities, then wash under cold water.
3. Set the pressure cooker to "saute" and caramelize the sugar and oil before dropping in the pork belly. Stir the pork belly to cover every surface with sugar. This will give the pork belly its color. 
4. Add dry and wet seasonings to the pressure cooker. Add enough liquid to almost cover all the ingredients. Mix the ingredients so they are alternating and the pork belly isn't stuck at the bottom.
5. Cook for 20 minutes on high pressure and vent naturally. 
6. After removing the solid ingredients, it sounds like I can store it for next time in the freezer if I add wet ingredients except for water again? I'll have to try this.
